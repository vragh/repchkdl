Description: Given a FTP URL hosting a collection of files, 
  repchkdl will repeatedly check if new files have been added 
  to the URL, after (optionally) checking and downloading upon 
  initialization. If new files are available, repchkdl will 
  indicate the files and offer to download them to a directory 
  of choice. Options to automate as well as fine tune the 
  checking and downloading procedures are available.
